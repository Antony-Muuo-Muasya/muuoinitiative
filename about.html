        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Established in 2021, MUUO Initiative is an initiative created with the sole purpose of creating and maintaining peaceful environments.
            The initiative title is derived from its founder, Antony Muuo Muasya who is a Songwriter, Actor, Pianist and the General Manager YSTV.
        <br>Also the term "MUUO" is a kamba word which stands for peace.</p>
        <h3>The importance of Biblical Peace Making</h3>
        <p>If you are around anyone long enough, or develop friendships of any kind, conflict is bound to happen. Conflict happens each and every day. This is especially true within a marriage and a family. If a family doesn't fight, then that probably means they don't talk to each other. You're a fallen, sinful human. You're married to a fallen, sinful human. You produced fallen, sinful little humans.
            Conflict is going to happen. So what we need to learn and study is God's word for that is how we go about resolving that conflict Biblically and how to start avoiding those conflicts in future.
        </p>         
        <h3>Why is Biblical Peacemkaing so vitally important to our marriages and our families today?</h3>
        <p>As you learn to be a peacemaker, you can guard your family from destructive conflict, deepen your love and intimacy with your spouse, and provide your children with a solid foundation of life. Most importantly, you can provide the world with a compelling witness to the reconcilling power of Jesus Christ.</p>
        
        <H3>Peace-Fakers Or Peace Breakers</H3> 
        <p>We can be peace-fakers, denying that we have problems, always giving in, or becoming distant from family members. We can be peace-breakers, relying on manipulation, a sharp tongue, or overt anger to compel others to give in to our wishes. Both of these approaches can wreak havoc on families, reducing them to superficial coexistence or burned-out battlegrounds.
        Our third option is to use the conflicts of family life to become peacemakers, drawing on God's grace and practicing the powerful peacemaking principles He has given to us in His word.
        This approach may require a lot of work and change, but it is the surest way to preserve your marriage and see your family mature in love, in character and in its witness for Christ.

              Teaching Your Children
            </li>
          </ul> 
        </h1>
        <p> occurs in almost every aspect of our life, and nearly almost every day to various degrees. In order to successfully navigate through conflict, we must efficiently practice peacemkaing. But peacemaking is not a natural instinct - it's a skill which we must learn.
        According to authors Ken Sande and Tom Raabe in their book Peacemaking for Families, the following 12 principles will help you mold your children into successful peacemakers. These principles will help you teach your childrean the importance of peacemaking skills in their daily lives, help them understand the causes of conflict and teach them how to resolve conflict peacefully. Though active times of teaching, modeling appropriate behaviour and giving them plenty of social interaction to practice and develop their skills, you will prepare them for successful relationships.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Responsibility
            </li>
          </ul> 
        </h1>
        <p> Sande describes conflict as a "slippery slope" with three zones. Explain to your childrean that when they face conflict, they have three choices: Escape, Attack or Work it out.The first two options have negativeconsequences that can create even larger problems and possibly ruin their relationships. Teach your children that conflict happens to everyone, and that solving it peacefully is the only positive solution. Explain that either avoiding the problem or going on the offensive will only make the situation worse.
        Sande explains that in the first danger zone, called the escape zoone, your children will try to avoid conflict, rather than solve it. They may either choose to deny the conflict, blame others, or run away from the situation. The second danger zone is called the Attack Zone, which involves attempting to win a fight rather than resolve it. These attacks often hurt the relationship rather than repair it, and include put downs and name-calling, gossiping and physical fighting.
        The positive response to conflict is found in the work-it-out zone. These options include overlooking and forgiving the offense, talking it out with the other person directly and seeking help from an adult on how t handle the situation.

          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About the Heart
            </li>
          </ul> 
        </h1>
        <p> When your children act out, it id often because something is troubling them internally. Yet children need to learn tha they are responsible for their actions, no matter what they are feeling inside.. Explain that they have the power to choose whether they will be obedient or disobedient, and that ultimately conflict begins within our own hearts.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Consequences
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Too often we use the term "consequence" as another word for "discipline" or "punishment".But consequences also means how our actions affecr other people. Make sure your children understand that their words, behaviors and attitudes not only affect themselves, but other people as well. When they are hurtful to another person, that has negative consequences. When they choose to help another person, that has positive consequences. Conflict is an example of a negative consequence stemming from an unwise choice or action.

        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Wisdom
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> It's easy to be selfish and make choices that are best for ourselves. But train your children to think of others when making decisions. Teach them how to make wise and right choices, how to obey authority, how to seek godly advice from others, and how to show respect to other people. Let them know that life is not about always seeking to have things our own way, but also look out for the prople around us.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Accountability
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Teach your children to be responsiblke for their behaviors. Don't let them blame other people for their own misbehavior or make excuses for their behavior. Let them know tha whenever we make mistakes, we must apologize without making excuses or blaming the other person. Let them know that "I am Sorry I did that, but you made me mad", is not an acceptable apology.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Opportunity
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Even through stressful conflicts, we have opportui=nities to shiw character and help others. Through tough situations, we have the chance to learn from our mistakes and become better people. When we see that we have hurt another person, we can use that situation to reconcile and improve our relationship. Let your children know that whenever they fail, there is still hope to turn a bad situation into a good one.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach Peacemaking Skills
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Sande provides the "Five A's of Conflict Resolution" which will help your children to remember how to walk through the peacemaking process. First, Admit the wrong - both wrong ,motives and actions. Second, Apologize for the offense and express sorrow. Third, Accept the consequences without excuses. Fourth, Ask for forgiveness. Fifth, Alter future choices and plan to act differently next time.
        Have your children memorize this list, and make sure they understand what each step means. Practice these skills by roleplaying conflict situations together. Point out examples (both good and bad) of conflict resolution on television, in movies and in books. Ask your children, ' How should that person have handled that situation?'What would you have done differently?'Like any skill, peacemaking must be learned and practiced in order to be most effective.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Forgiveness
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Forgiveness is not saying an empty, "I'm sorry."Forgiveness does not mean you don't feel mad at someone anymore. Forgiveness is a choice that your children must make. Sande explains that when we forgive someone, we internally make four promises to that person. First, we promise not to dwell on the other person's mistake. Second, we promise not to use the situation as a weapon later, ("Remember that time you....") or hold it over that person's head to make them feel gulty. Third, we promise not to gossip or talk about that person's mistake to other peopl. Fourth, we promise to become friends to that person again. Sande provides the following poem that will help your children remember these four promises: Good thought , hurt you not, Gossip never, Friends forever."

              Teach A bout Choices
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Sometimes we fall into the mentality of "I've already messed this one up, why bother?" But teach your children that when they find themselves in a conflict poorly, they can always stop their current actions, think through a better plan of action and then follow that wiser plan.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Thoughtfulness
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Sometimes children (and adults) blurt out the first thing on their minds, especially when they are upset. But teach your childrean how to thoughtfully consider their words before speaking. Teach them to count to 10 to calm themselves down before responding to someone who has angered them. Teach them to think through the best course of action before confronting someone. Teach them to look at the situation through the eyes of a peacemaker, and not someone who just wants to fight back.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Respect
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Treating people with respect is not only beneficial for other people, but for ourselves as well. Explain to your children that their attempts at peacemaking will go much better if they talk and act with respect to the other person. Ask them how the feel when soemone disrespects them - are they more likely or less likely to listen to that person? Showing respect means choosing affirming words, listening to the other person, using a calm tone voice and displaying engaging body language such as making eye contact. Let them know that name-calling, blaming the other person, yelling, whining, pouting, arm-crossing. eye rolling and foot tapping are all signs of disrespect.
        </p>
        <h1>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Teach About Appeals
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Teach your children how to make a respectfl appeal to another person. Explain that this simple step can help avoid conflict. Instead of demanding a toy or a favor from someone, your children will find much more success (and much less conflict) b giving a respectful appeal. Sande explains the process as first stopping yourself from saying or doing something that will cause conflict. Then think about the words you will use to ask for what you want. Then use "I" messages and questions to communicate the appeal (teach your childrean that an 'I' message is saying somethung like, "I would like to use that doll now,"instad of the "you" message of "you always get to play with that!"). The final step in an appeal is being prepared to respond respectfully - even if you don't get what you want. This last step requires self control and the ability to shiw grace and respect even in the face of defeat.
        </p>
        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

        <p>Teaching your children to wisely prevent and handle conflicts will take plenty of practice. Through time they will begin to learn valuable character lessons in respect, selflessness and selfcontrol that will aid them in the peacemaking process. Be sure to incorporate lessons in their daily lives as you see them interact with siblings, as you watch television or read a book together, and as you model peacemaking skills in your own conflicts. Make the lessons fun- create games and award prizes as they memorize the five A's of conflict resolution and the four promises of forgiveness. Reward your children with praise whenevre you see them handke a situation peacefully.The lessons will take planning and effort on your part, but you will be instilling valuable skills and character traits which will give your children a lifetime of successful and peaceful relationships.

        <h3>WAYS TO CREATE A MORE PEACEFULL LIFE</h3>
        <h1> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Seek to love , not control others
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Ceasing to seek power over people and outcomes in your life is the first major step to living peacefully. Trying to control people is about seeking to impose your will and reality on others without stopping to see their side of things. A controlling approach to relationships will keep you in conflicts with others. Replacing a will to control with a broad approach of loving others instead, including their faults and differences, is the way to a peaceful life.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul type="1">
            <li>
              Find your Inner Peace
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> At least once a day spend ten minutes in a peaceful place, such as under a shady tree or in the park, anywhere where you can sit quietly without distractions. Wwithout inner peace, you'll feel in a constant state of conflict. Trying to fill your life with possessions or improving yourself by social climbing without stopping to valueyour inner worth will leave you perpetually unhappy. When you're angry, find a nice quiet place to stop, take a deep breath, and relax. Turn off the TV and Computer. Get out into nature if possible , or go for a good , long walk. Put on some soft soft music or turn down the lighsts. When you feel calm again, get up and go on with your life.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Moderate Your Convictions
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Thinking in absolutes and holding to opinions without considering the viewpointsof others is a sure way to live a life without peace. This type of extremist thinking usualy leads to reactive, hasty and driven behavior that lacks the benefit of reflection. This approach can easily lead you into conflict when other people fail to agree with your convictions. Remain open-minded and ready to review your understanding. It's more rewarding because you'll grow as a person and live in grater harmony with thise around you.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Be Tolerant
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Tolerance in all that you think and do will make a difference in your life in the lives of others around you. Tolerance for others is about appreaciating diversity, the plurality of modern society and being willing to live and let others live too. When you fail to tolerate others's beliefs, ways of being , and opinions , the end result can be discrimination, repression, dehumanization and ultimately violence.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Be Peace
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> A peaceful person does not use violence against another person or animal (that includes small obnoxious insects too). While there is much violence in this world, make a choice to not let death and killing be a part of your philosophy of living.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Reflection of Thought.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> If someone hurts you physically or mentally, do not react with anger or violence. Stop and think. Choose instead to respond peacefully.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Seek Forgiveness not Revenge
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Live in the present, not the past. Dwelling on that which should have been and reliving past wounds will keep the negativity of the past alive and bring constant internal conflict. Forgiveness allows you to live in the present to look forward to the future and to let the past settle gently. Forgiveness is the ultimate victory because it let's you enjoy life again by making peace with the past.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Live in Joy
            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Choosing to see the wonders of the world is an antidote to violence. It's hard to be violent against that which you see as beautiful, wondrous, amazing and joyful.The greatest despair arising from wars comes from the dstruction of innocence, beauty and joy. Joy brings peace to your life because you're always prepared to see what is good in others and the world, and to be grateful for the wondrousaspects of life.
        </p>
        <h1> 
          <ul>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </h1>
        <p> Violence starts with your acceptance of its possibility as a solution. It's within yourself that you need to stop violence and become peaceful. Change yourself before you can change th world. At the end of the day, living in peace will be your own consious choice. You're free to choose your own path, but whatever way you go, keep in mind that all your actions will affect those around you.
